# odin-recipes

A very primitive, html-only collection of basic recipes taken from allrecipes.com

## How to run

This is an extremely simple project and has no requirements but you having a browser.

1. clone into the repository:
```git
git clone git@github.com:jiggly-git/odin-recipes.git
```
2. cd into the directory
```
cd odin-recipes
```
3. Either open index.html and run the project or if using live-server on vs code open index.html source code in vscode and press `Alt-L Alt-O`

## Future of this repo

I will probably be privating this in the future, it took me less than an hour of programming to get this running so its probably not worth having on here.

More to come on my profile in the future though.

Thank you! - Basel
